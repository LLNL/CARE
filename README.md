CARE: CHAI and RAJA Extensions
===============================
CHAI and RAJA provide an excellent base on which to build portable code. CARE expands that functionality, adding new features such as loop fusion capability, a portable interface for many numerical algorithms, and additional data structures. It provides all the basics for anyone wanting to write portable code.

Getting Started
===============
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../   # May need to pass -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/in if the next instruction fails
make -j install
```

If desired, external libraries can be used instead of submodules. For example, an external CHAI can be specified with `-DCHAI_DIR=<path to CHAI install directory or directory containing chai-config.cmake>`. Note that if using an external CHAI, it must be configured with `-DENABLE_PICK=ON -DENABLE_PINNED=ON`.

To build with CUDA support, use `-DENABLE_CUDA=ON -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cuda/toolkit`. If using external libraries, note that Umpire, RAJA, and CHAI must also be configured with those options.
 
To build with HIP support, set `-DENABLE_HIP=ON -DHIP_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/rocm/hip/ -DHIP_CLANG_PATH=/path/to/rocm/clang`. If using external libraries, note that Umpire, RAJA, and CHAI must also be configured with those options. If using an external BLT, note that version 0.6.1 or later is required. Other compilers besides the hip vendor-supplied clang compiler have not yet been tried for HIP builds.
 
To build with OpenMP support, use `-DENABLE_OPENMP=ON`. If using external libraries, Umpire, RAJA, and CHAI must also be configured with that option.

By default, only the tests are built. Documentation, benchmarks, and examples can be turned on with `-DENABLE_DOCS=ON`, `-DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON`, and `-DENABLE_EXAMPLES=ON`.
